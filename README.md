# Medi8

Medi8 is a Core Data model for music media. It's designed to aggregate data from multiple
online databases, including [Discogs](https://discogs.com) and
[MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org), although its schema is independent of all of them, and
does not provide support for importing from or exporting to any of them itself. (My other
projects, such as [SwiftDiscogs](https://github.com/jrtibbetts/SwiftDiscogs) and
[SwiftMusicbrainz](https://github.com/jrtibbetts/SwiftMusicbrainz), are intended to do that.)
